### A 'to do' list using weather API written in React.js

The project involves:
- building application using React.js logic (stateful components managing their own states);
- making use of React built in features such as component lifecycles, JSX syntax, DOM render;
- implementation of fetch method (Open Weather API);
- using local storage (user-sorted list of tasks, city (weather)),
- RWD (although project wasn't ment to be responsive, there was a way found to make it look good on mobile devices);
- importing and using external plugins/modules (Flip Move);
